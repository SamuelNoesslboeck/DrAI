Output:
“A whimsical and joyful scene comes to life in this imaginative illustration, as a goat stands proudly on a fence, surrounded by a bountiful landscape of rolling hills and lush greenery. In the background, a flying cow soars through the sky, its wings spread wide in a playful gesture. Meanwhile, a pig happily frolics in the foreground, its curly tail wagging with excitement. The piece is inspired by the works of Bill Traylor and William Steig, but with a unique twist that brings to mind the surrealism of Joan Miro and the playfulness of Andy Milonakis as a goat. With 8k high quality detailed art and a vibrant color palette, this image is sure to bring a smile to anyone's face.”
