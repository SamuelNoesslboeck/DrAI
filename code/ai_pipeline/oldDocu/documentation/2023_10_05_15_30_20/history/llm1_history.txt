Meanwhile, a flying pig (inspired by Joan Miro) soars overhead, leaving a trail of sparkling stars in its wake. The entire image is infused with a playful, dreamlike quality, as if it were plucked straight from the imagination of a child. The details are rendered in stunning 8k high-quality detail, making every strand of grass and every twitch of the goat's whiskers visible in exquisite detail. This magical scene is sure to bring a smile to anyone who sees it, inspiring joy and wonder in all who lay eyes on it.
