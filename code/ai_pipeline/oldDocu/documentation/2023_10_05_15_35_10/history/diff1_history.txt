Its Jim Davis-inspired beak and perry the platypus-esque body are only surpassed by the Ren & Stimpy-style spaceship it pilots! The craft takes cues from Matt Groening's design sense, with a quacking cockpit and Donald Duck-like wings. But watch out for the Jubjub bird - this extraterrestrial menace may just have you saying 'Beware!' in no time!"
