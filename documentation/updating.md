# Updating

The software also has an automated updating script that checks all the software for updates, simply execute it by navigating to the projects root folder:

```sh
cd ~/DrAI
sh "code/scripts/update.sh"
```

This update script works for *every* device. Make sure to restart your device afterwards to correctly setup the autostart process:

```sh
sudo reboot
```
