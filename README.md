## Summary

### Goal

We want to demonstrate the capabilities of AI in completing "creative" tasks in collaboration with humans.

### Task

The final result will be an interactive robot equipped with an AI trained to interpret pre-drawn sketches from the user and complete them with its own "creativity".  
To start this interaction, the user will have to draw some sketch onto a piece of paper, which then is transported into the robot. Once the sheet is in the robot, its goal is to unwrap its "creative" potentials by drawing additional lines onto the paper of the user. The opportunities are limitless here, the AI can for example create a forest next to a cottage the user has drawn onto the sheet, or a beach to some water and so on.

The project can be split up into the two main parts AI (or in general software) and the robot (hardware).
